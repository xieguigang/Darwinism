    ''' A message type that has a custom string format for diagnostic purposes.

    ''' <remarks>
    ''' <para>
    ''' Calling <see cref="Object.ToString"/> on a generated message type normally
    ''' returns the JSON representation. If a message type implements this interface,
    ''' then the <see cref="ToDiagnosticString"/> method will be called instead of the regular
    ''' JSON formatting code, but only when <c>ToString()</c> is called either on the message itself
    ''' or on another message which contains it. This does not affect the normal JSON formatting of
    ''' the message.
    ''' </para>
    ''' <para>
    ''' For example, if you create a proto message representing a GUID, the internal
    ''' representation may be a <c>bytes</c> field or four <c>fixed32</c> fields. However, when debugging
    ''' it may be more convenient to see a result in the same format as <see cref="System.Guid"/> provides.
    ''' </para>
    ''' <para>This interface extends <see cref="IMessage"/> to avoid it accidentally being implemented
    ''' on types other than messages, where it would not be used by anything in the framework.</para>

        ''' This method is called when a message is formatted as part of a <see cref="Object.ToString"/>
        ''' call. It does not affect the JSON representation used by <see cref="JsonFormatter"/> other than
        ''' in calls to <see cref="JsonFormatter.ToDiagnosticString(IMessage)"/>. While it is recommended
        ''' that the result is valid JSON, this is never assumed by the Protobuf library.
