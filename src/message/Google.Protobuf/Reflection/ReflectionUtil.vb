    ''' In order to run on iOS (no JIT) we had to use Invoke which results in a bit
    ''' of a performance cost. The original description is as follows:
    ''' The methods in this class are somewhat evil, and should not be tampered with lightly.
    ''' Basically they allow the creation of relatively weakly typed delegates from MethodInfos
    ''' which are more strongly typed. They do this by creating an appropriate strongly typed
    ''' delegate from the MethodInfo, and then calling that within an anonymous method.
    ''' Mind-bending stuff (at least to your humble narrator) but the resulting delegates are
    ''' very fast compared with calling Invoke later on.
